## :blond_haired_man: A Little Bit About Me...
Hello! I'm Fraser, a recent graduate of the Games Design course at the University of Suffolk :mortar_board:. I'm a game designer with a variety of interests spanning from emotive design to procedural generation and much, much more!

I design and develop games, as well as tools aimed to empower developers. If you have any inquiries about any of my projects, please get in touch using my details below. 

## :email: Let's Get Connected!
The best way of reaching out to me is via the contact page of my website [here][contact-me]! I also have a presence on the following social media sites:

## :ledger: What am I Currently Working on?
After receiving some commendations from developers who found my [UE4 Maze Generator][maze-generator] useful, I'm currently implementing some major new features (a sneak peek can be found on the dev branch [here](https://github.com/frasergeorgeking/UE4_BP_MazeGen_MIT/tree/dev) :eyes:). Vastly improved documentation, including on tile importing, CSV exporting and data table set-up is also coming soon.

Additionally, I have a brand new procedural level design tool in the pipeline, which I hope to share more details about very shortly! :hourglass_flowing_sand:

I'm also regularly chipping away at full game development - keep your eyes peeled on my social media channels for a behind the scenes look.

### :books: Current Reading 
I'm always trying to better myself and learn new and interesting things! I try to balance my reading between psychology and design books, as well as books with a more technical focus - here's what I'm reading at the moment:

[:desktop_computer: Petzold, C. (2000) *Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software.*  Redmond, Washington: Microsoft Press.](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1972516W/Code?edition=codehiddenlangua00petz_793)

### :video_game: Current Games
Making games is brilliant, however I also like to find time to play them too! Here's what I'm playing at the moment:
