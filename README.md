# :wave: Hi There, I'm Fraser!

## :blond_haired_man: A Little Bit About Me...

Hello! I'm Fraser, a senior game developer with experience designing and implementing game systems. I have a variety of interests spanning from emotive design to procedural generation and much, much more!

I'm currently going through something of a rebrand at the moment, so please bear with me whilst I shuffle the furniture around 🪑.

If you need to reach out to me, your best bet is to connect with me on [LinkedIn](linkedin). You can also find out more about me on my website - [fraserk.dev](https://fraserk.dev).
